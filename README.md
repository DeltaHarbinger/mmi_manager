# mmi_manager

App used to validate, store and run common MMI and USSD codes used by Jamaicans. The app was created targeting MMI as USSD codes commonly used by FLOW and Digicel to perform tasks including, but not limited to:

* Credit TopUp - \*121\*\<voucher code\>\#
* Checking Credit Balance - \*120\# OR \*120\*1\# for postpaid Digicel numbers
* Check Data Plan Status - \*129\*6\*7\# for FLOW
* Send Credit - \*128\*\<target phone number\>\*\<amount\>\#

The current app does not have coverage for all MMI and USSD codes.

Phones with multiple sim cards are supported. The target sim card to execute the USSD code may be selected.
